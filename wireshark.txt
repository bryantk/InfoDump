What it does:
Listens to all network traffic (on specified connection) and spits out a nice pcap file. It can also search, filter,
and parse the data.

How to:
Run the program, select a network adapter, press go (make sure it is the right connection). all network traffic is displayed
originally by time, but can be sorted as the user pleases.
This tool is amazing and its use goes much deeper than my knowledge.

Things to recall:
	-Right click any TCP and 'follow stream' to follow the connection.
	-Use the filters!
