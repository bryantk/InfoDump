What it does:
Listens and/or sends data over the network. A quick and simple file sharing setup.

How to:
For windows, carry around the .exes (run via command line). Unix systems have it already.
A must for digital forensics for it is the quickest and most unobtrusive way to send files back to a trusted source.

The trusted computer should lsiten for data and pipe it to a file for safe keeping:
nc -l -v -p port_number_of_your_choice > text_file_to_save_to

-l is to Listen for data
-Verbose


To send data, simply pipe it to "nc ip_of_trusted_computer port"



Netcat is not a one trick pony.
It can port scan:
	nc -z host_ip_or_name ##-##		returns list of open ports in the range

or be a backdoor for remote commands
	add "-e command_to_run" and point it to cmd.exe for remote code execution
	or add "-c" (it defaults to cmd.exe)
	As for 'nix point -e to '/bin/bash'

or piping data (http headers?) to a server
	printf "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n" | nc host_ip_or_name 80
