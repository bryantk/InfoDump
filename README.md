# InfoDump 

What is this?

Remember using an awesome tool once long ago? It was epic and did everything you needed and more. Well, now you need to use it
again... and don't recall exactly what to do - or - you can make you way around it still and know it has an uber feature... that
you don't recall how to activate.
This is a succinct database containing those bits of awesome that should not be forgotten.

Why a public git Repo?
If you don't want free access to some cool 'quick start' guides, ok... go away then. For everyone else, why hide info when you can
share it. Most of what I know came from Google anyways, so here is my attempt at giving back a bit. Also, as a git repo, you can
add you own cool tools and tricks, correct my errors, or even branch it off and steal it as your own (don't do that). Ideally, I will
update this whenever I stumble across another new thing.
