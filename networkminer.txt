What it does:
Listens to all network traffic (on specified connection) while pulling recognized artefacts (images, large files, plain text
passwords etc. ) and organizing them. Also groups and identifies hosts.

How to:
Run the program, select a network adapter, press go. It will grab and organize everything it recognizes.
This program is great for monitoring and understanding what is going on over a connection, however it has some shortcomings.

Pros:
	-Two clicks is all it takes.
	-Organizes capture sessions into 'case' files.
	-Organizes lots of data.
	-Can set up 'trigger' words to search for
	-Supported protocols for file extraction are FTP, TFTP, HTTP, SMB and SMTP
	-Can read from pcap files.

Cons:
	-Data capture rate limit (not indented to capture all network data; i.e. sit on a switch).
	-Not good for non-files (like when a back-door requests 'cat /etc/passwd').
